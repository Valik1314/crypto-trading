"""Service layer for the crypto trading application.

Modules in this package implement lowâ€‘level integrations (such as
Binance REST calls) and indicator computations.  The service layer is
designed to be stateless and free of FastAPI dependencies so that it
can be imported from both API handlers and unit tests.
